<div style="text-align:justify">
Our team leveraged our knowledge and skills in Algorithms and Data Structures to implement our Line project. Game Line 98 is a very popular game that has been available on PC since 2003. A classic ball game with bright neon graphics. The content of the game is very simple, and you can score points by aligning three or more balls of the same color vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. Players try to score as many points as possible. There are many interesting levels that increase in difficulty the more players want to challenge them. This is the data structures and algorithms final project semester (2022-2023).

### How to play ? 
Color Lines is a traditional puzzle game in which players must form lines of five or more balls of the same color on a grid-based board. After finishing a game, players are requested to enter their name into an option pane. After entering their name, a scoreboard appears, displaying the top players and their respective scores. The game starts with a randomized grid of colored balls, and players must move the balls intelligently to build lines.Players can make moves to create lines by selecting a ball and a target cell.When five or more balls of the same color form a line, those balls are removed from the board and points are awarded.
